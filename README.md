# GeoImageNet
This repository explains how to use the Mahine Learning API from the [GeoImageNet](https://geoimagenet.ca) platform. The API is composed of two parts:
1. Access to the annotations and the taxonomies: https://geoimagenet.ca/api/v1/redoc
2. A ML API (restricted to registered users only): https://geoimagenet.ca/ml/api#

## Notebooks
A few notebbooks are demonstrating the basic use cases of the platform. They can be executed with Google Colab.
* Packaging of a patch classification model: [classif_model_packaging](https://github.com/crim-ca/geoimagenet/blob/master/classif_model_packaging.ipynb) 
* Packaging of a SegNet model: [seg_model_packaging](https://github.com/crim-ca/geoimagenet/blob/master/seg_model_packaging.ipynb)
